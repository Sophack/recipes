## Random Recipes App

# Description: 
This application uses API data to help the user find recipes from around the world. By default it will generate a random recipe. 
The user can search for keywords or specific names to find recipes with information about ingredients & cooking time & pictures. The recipes are shown with a heart icon that saves the information to local storage and makes it visible on the 'favourites' carousel on the top below the search bar.  

#Installation:
Used API to get meal info from https://www.themealdb.com/api.php 
Used https://fonts.googleapis.com/ to get custom fonts 

#Usage: 

By default it generates a random recipe & has no favorite data saved

Once the user chooses some favorites it will show up in the carousel under "Favorite Meals". The heart icon becomes colored when the recipe has been saved into favorites

Clicking on the recipe will show the detailed information

#Future development: 
Currently the recipe pops up when the heart button is clicked & the user must click on the "X" at the top right of the pop up in order to get rid of it.

This pop window also appears when the favorites are edited (moved around or deleted)

It would improve the UI if this did not happen every time or if the user was able to get rid of it using keyboard functions like 'ESC' key.
